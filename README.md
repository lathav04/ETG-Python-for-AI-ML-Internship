JSON Based Inventory Management System

This repository has the code for creating a JSON based Inventory Management System. This is my first project in the Skill India Python for AI/ML Internship from Elite Techno Groups.
It consists of a json file called records.json which consists of the items in the inventory. The user can view the items in the iventory and purchase them by entering the product_id and quantity. The name and total cost of the items purchased will be displayed. Then the inventory will be updated after the purchase.
The sales.json file contains the details of items purchased by the user.
New items can also be added to the inventory and if required we can also delete any item from the inventory.
